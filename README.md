# Hour of Code Game

This is a 2-Player game which has 3 modes:

* Human vs Human
* Human vs Agent
* Agent vs Agent
  
A player has to draw or exchange cards from the board cards so that the sum of his/her cards would be 15.

No one can have more than 3 cards in his/her hand, and a player must draw or exchange a card.

The main purpose of this game is that students have to write an agent with Python language, and compete with each other and brawl!

This game is developed by [Amirreza Ektesabi](https://github.com/ar-ekt/) (Game Design) and [Amirhosein Gharaati](https://github.com/AmirHosein-Gharaati/) (UI/UX design)
